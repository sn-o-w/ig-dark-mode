# ig-dark-mode

This is my very own implementation of desktop dark mode for Instagram.

Ran initially as an experiment to learn CSS, I do keep learning it.

**NOTE:** This is a userscript, you need an userscript manager in order to run it.

### TODO
Â - Update/improve descriptions for all vague elements
